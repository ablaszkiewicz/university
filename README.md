# University
This repository is mostly for documentary purposes of my university projects, however some of them are non trivial-sized and worth taking look at:
- (RSA + hybrid) files encryption app (C# WPF)
- YOLO V3 playing cards detector + data artificial augmenter (Python)
- Genetic vs PSO algorithms comparison in a function minimization (Python)
