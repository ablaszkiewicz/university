# University
This repository is mostly for documentary purposes of my university projects, however some of them are non trivial-sized and worth taking look at:
- (RSA + hybrid) files encryption [app](https://github.com/ablaszkiewicz/university/tree/main/C%23/rsa-encryption) (C# WPF)
- YOLO V3 playing cards detector + artificial data [augmenter](https://github.com/ablaszkiewicz/university/tree/main/Python/yolo-cards-detection-augmenter) (Python)
- Genetic vs PSO algorithms comparison [app](https://github.com/ablaszkiewicz/university/tree/main/Python/genetic-vs-pso-comparison) in a function minimization task (Python)
